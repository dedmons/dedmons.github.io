This is a family recipe from my wife and is part of most holiday breakfast in home.

This recipe makes enough to fill 2 round 9 inch cake pans. I have split the recipe in half to make one pan of cinnamon rolls and one pan of dinner rolls from the same dough.

### Ingredients: ###
#### The Dough: ####
- 7 g yeast
- 2 Tbs sugar
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup shortening
- 2 tsp salt
- 6-8 cups AP flour

#### Cinnamon Filling: ####
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 3 Tbs cinnamon
- 4 Tbs butter (melted)

#### Caramel Glaze: ####
- 12 Tbs butter (softened)
- 1 1/2 cups brown sugar
- 3 Tbs corn syrup

### Method: ###
Start by blooming yeast in 1/2 cup of lukewarm water with the 2 tablespoons of sugar. Next in a large mixing bowl add 1/2 cup of shortening, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 2 teaspoons salt with 2 cups of lukewarm water. Stir bloomed yeast and add to mixing bowl. Gradually add in flour until dough stops taking it on and is not sticky.

Let the dough rest for about 10 min covered with a damp towel.

This dough can be used for either cinnamon rolls or dinner rolls. See below for specific instructions.

After preparing the pans let rise in fridge over night then bring them to room temp before baking. If you make the dough same day you can let rise at room temp covered with a damp cloth until almost doubled in size or a few hours.

You can freeze the prepared pans if you make a few days ahead of time. Thaw in fridge the day before or over night on the counter. It's important to let the rolls come up to room temp before baking that way the entire pan cooks and the center is not raw.

Bake at 400°F for 15-20 min or until tops are light brown and internal temp is over 170°F.

#### Dinner Rolls ####
For dinner rolls, roll out dough on flowered surface to about a quarter to half inch thick. Then punch out rounds with a biscuit cutter. Add rolls to buttered baking pans.

#### Cinnamon Rolls ####
Start by beating all ingredients for glaze together until thoroughly mixed and spread in bottom of baking pans. Next roll out dough on flowered surface to about 24 inches long rectangle and about a quarter inch thick. Spread melted butter over the dough then sprinkle cinnamon sugar mixture and any additional spices. Roll up the dough and slice about every one inch. Place in the pans on top of the glaze.

### Notes: ###
I have had the most success by not freezing the dough even though it can be useful to freeze before traveling. That means I will make the rolls after dinner the nigh before I intend to bake them.
