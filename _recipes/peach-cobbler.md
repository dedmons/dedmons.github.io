## For a few people ##
This version of the peach cobbler makes a large batch. I use a 12 inch cast iron skillet, if you half the recipe you can probably use a 10 inch skillet.

Adapted from [here](https://www.thisgrandmaisfun.com/two-two-easy-peach-cobbler/).

### Ingredients: ###
- 4-6 Peaches cut into wedges
    - You can use canned or frozen peaches
- 1 stick butter
- 2 cups milk
- 2 cups flour
- 2 cups sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- (Optional) Spices
    - I like cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, and/or a "pumpkin spice" blend.

### Method: ###
1. Preheat oven to 350°F with skillet inside
2. Once oven is preheated add butter to skillet to melt. Keep an eye on it so it does not get too brown.
3. While the butter is melting mix up the batter.
4. When the butter is melted, remove skillet from oven and add peaches to butter. Then pour batter over top.
5. Bake for 45 minutes or until the top is golden brown. It may take a up to 60 minutes.

## Just for 2 ##
This is a smaller recipe that makes a great starving for 2. It can be make in one baking dish at lease 2 cups in volume or 2 individual ramekins.
