title: Lemon Cake with Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting
---

## The Cake ##
### Ingredients: ###
- 2 1/4 cups cake flour
- 1 Tbsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 1/4 cups buttermilk
- 4 egg whites
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 2 tsp grated lemon zest
- 1 stick unsalted butter, room temp (8 Tbsp / 4 oz)
- 1/2 tsp lemon extract

### Method: ###
1. Sift together the dry ingredients. Mix the buttermilk and egg whites together.
2. Rub the sugar and lemon zest together (this releases the lemon flavor!), then cream in the butter and lemon extract.
3. Add the dry and wet ingredients, alternating the two.
4. Pour the batter into two parchment-lined cake pans, and smooth the tops. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes at 350 degrees F. Let cool to room temperature.
5. Prepare the frosting, then frost and decorate the cake as desired. (If possible let the cake set for about 40 minutes.)
